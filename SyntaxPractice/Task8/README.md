Develop a class hierarchy of employees. The hierarchy should include three classes:

Employee is the base class. It includes three fields (name, email and integer variable experience), one constructor with three arguments and three getters: getName(), getEmail(), getExperience().
Developer is a subclass. It includes fields from the base class and two additional fields (mainLanguage, skills), one constructor with five arguments and two getters: getMainLanguage(), getSkills().
DataAnalyst is another subclass. It includes fields from the base class and two additional fields (phd, methods), one constructor with five arguments and two getters: isPhd(), getMethods().
