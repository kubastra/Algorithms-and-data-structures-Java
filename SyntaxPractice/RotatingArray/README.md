A right rotation is an operation that shifts each element of an array to the right. For example, if an array is {1,2,3,4,5} and we right rotate it by 1, the new array will be {5,1,2,3,4}. If we rotate it by 2, the new array will be {4,5,1,2,3}. It goes like this: {1,2,3,4,5} -> {5,1,2,3,4} -> {4,5,1,2,3}.

Implement rotate method that performs a right rotation on an array by a given number.

Note that If your solution gets the code quality warning "System.arraycopy is more efficient", please simply ignore it for this code challenge.
